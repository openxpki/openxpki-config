# OpenXPKI Upgrade Hints

We try hard to build releases that do not break old installations but
sometimes we are forced to make changes that require manual adjustment
of existing config or even the database schema.

Please read the sections below **before** you upgrade the code packages.

## Release v3.32

This release has several breaking changes you must address when upgrading:

* New socket and permission layout
* Mandatory version identifiers in config and database
* Updates to YAML config due to new YAML parser
* Changed logfile location for frontend logs
* Realm URLs must be unique

This release also introduces a new technical layer for the web frontend
which comes with a new configuration layout and is the default when you
install the system from scratch. We recommend to migrate you existing
configuration to the new system. The old layer is still supported but
you need to make some minor adjustments to your configuration to run it.

### Socket and permissions

The frontend client now runs as a dedicated process and the communication
sockets are now inside `/run`, permissions and process logic is now handled
mostly by systemd. The socket of the backend client is now at
`/run/openxpkid/openxpkid.sock`, the package installer creates a symlink
if the old location exists but it is easier to just remove the socket
location from all config files as the new release assumes the new location
as default in any place.

The owner and group permissions have been changed for the new layout, if you
want to run the old frontend, you need to adjust the permission so the
webserver can talk to the backend!

### Mandatory Versioning

Add the depend node in the file `system/version.yaml`:

```yaml
    depend:
      core: 3.32
      config: 2
```

You also need to add a version identifier to the SQL tables, check if your
schema is up to date - instructions to add the schema are in the SQL files.

### YAML Update

OpenXPKI uses the pattern `+YYMMDD...` to specify relative dates in several
places. In the old configuration those are given as plain strings, e.g.

```yaml
    validity:
        notafter: +01
```

The new YAML parser interpretes this as number and strips the leading
zeros which leads to unexpected behaviour and malformat errors. Please
review your configuration and add quotes around:

```yaml
    validity:
        notafter: "+01"
```

### Logfiles

The default logger configuration for the webfrontend / client parts is now
`/var/log/openxpki-ui`. As the installer creates this with permissions set
for the new layout you need to change this to run the old frontend.
Unability to write to this folder will crash the frontend immediately.

### Realm URLs

Due to changes in the URL handling it is no longer possible to use
`/webui/index/` to log into the PKI with the old frontend code when only
one realm is configured. If you do not want to upgrade, use the realm map
and assign a dedicated name to your realm, e.g. `/webui/democa/`.
